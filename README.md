If you are familar with Bitcoin/Litecoin you know the wallet above. The patented "superpooper-hightec-software" is a simply [litecoin-clone](https://github.com/coinnoob/platincoin_scam/commit/19c6507c2bcc13fc9df8bc516aed14f4ca52f3ec#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8)

This superdecentralized shitcoin-blockchain is powered by almost 2300 H/s ;) -- Everybody can launch 51% attack ;)

### UPDATE:

... a lot of questions since my last sneek into this shitcoin ... hope this will help:

1. dont wonder if you cannot [compare](https://github.com/platincoin-project/platincoin/compare/master...coinnoob:master) the fork - the "developers" made a new init to avoid that - but there is no change in the code ;)

2. there is NO [Proof of Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) (PoS) - its a simply [cryptonight PoW](https://github.com/coinnoob/platincoin_scam/blob/master/src/crypto/CryptoNight.cpp#L25L37)! you can find the function (mining) [here](https://github.com/coinnoob/platincoin_scam/blob/master/src/miner.cpp#L132L229).

2. dont buy the plc "miniting" box - complete scam (inside info). in best case its a full node to spread that shitcoin. its NOT possible to mine/mint coins with this box! this shitcoin is a PREMINED coin - that means (in that special case) 600.000.000 shitcoins "mined" in the first 100 blocks!

### THE PROOF:

first of all - a full synced node (over tor bc anon matters):

<img src="https://image.ibb.co/n6RFMK/plc_getinfo.png" alt="plc_getinfo" border="0">

... now you can explore the first block with the txid inclusive

<img src="https://image.ibb.co/kq3y8z/plc_getblock_1.png" alt="plc_getblock_1" border="0">

... so you can see - 6.000.000 premined coins in the first block

<img src="https://image.ibb.co/dP8vMK/plc_first_block.png" alt="plc_first_block" border="0">

... the same the 99 next "blocks" (here block 100):

<img src="https://image.ibb.co/bSBFMK/plc_block_100.png" alt="plc_block_100" border="0">

... and the last 6 mio output at block 100:

<img src="https://image.ibb.co/e6KwTz/plc_6mio_block100.png" alt="plc_6mio_block100" border="0">

... since block 101 the [mining reward](https://github.com/coinnoob/platincoin_scam/blob/master/src/miner.cpp#L195L199) is 0.005.

<img src="https://image.ibb.co/c3xfMK/plc_block_101.png" alt="plc_block_101" border="0">

... and the output:

<img src="https://image.ibb.co/cn4wTz/plc_txid_101.png" alt="plc_txid_101" border="0">

### CONCLUSION

6 mio * 100 * 5 USD @ yobit.net >> more $$$ than god.

if you buy this "minting box" you will simply get a couple of the shitcoins by the owner of the premined coins - such simple is that!

### todo

I dont have time 4 this repo - if someone have new infos - feel free to commit (remember - will merge it only with proof attached!!)
